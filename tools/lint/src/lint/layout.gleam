//// R10 and R11: whether the code was written in stanzas.
////
//// # Why a rule about blank lines
////
//// Loom's comment register is not decoration (`CLAUDE.md`, "Literate
//// code"): a reader should be able to follow a module's ownership model and
//// its failure behaviour by reading its prose in order. That only works if
//// the prose is *findable*, and what makes a comment findable is the blank
//// line above it. A comment welded to the statement above reads as that
//// statement's footnote; the same comment with a blank line above it is the
//// heading of the paragraph below, and the eye can skip between headings.
//// Every editor's fold, every diff hunk header, and every reader scanning a
//// four-hundred-line module for the part they need depends on that one
//// blank line.
////
//// The second half is the same argument without the comment. A function
//// written as one unbroken block of twenty statements has no paragraphs, so
//// there is nowhere for the prose to go and nothing for a reader to hold
//// onto between the top and the bottom. R11 measures that directly: the
//// longest run of statements with nothing between any two of them.
////
//// # Why this is a separate module
////
//// `glance` throws layout away. Comments are not in the AST at all and
//// blank lines leave no trace, so `lint/scan` — which is the AST walk and
//// nothing else — is structurally unable to answer either question. What
//// this module does instead is collect, from the tree, *where each sibling
//// begins*, and hand those offsets back to be resolved against the file's
//// own line table (`lint/source.classify`). The judgement is then made in
//// line numbers, over a classification made once per file.
////
//// # Why offsets and not lines
////
//// The walk emits byte offsets and asks about lines afterwards, which is
//// the same discipline `lint/scan` keeps and for the same reason: resolving
//// an offset to a line means walking the file's line index, so a conversion
//// per statement would be a walk of the file per statement. `blocks` runs
//// once, `source.line_map` resolves every offset it produced in one merged
//// pass, and `findings` reads the answers out of a table.
////
//// # What the rules do not look at
////
//// Neither rule counts lines of code. A `json.Object([#("k", …)])` literal
//// the formatter broke over thirty lines is one statement here, exactly as
//// it is depth zero to R2 — that distinction is the whole reason this tool
//// parses rather than measuring columns, and it applies to density just as
//// it applies to nesting. It follows that a comment *inside* such a literal
//// is invisible to R10: it annotates an element of a data structure rather
//// than opening a stanza, no blank line is owed above it, and the rule sees
//// only the gaps between siblings.
