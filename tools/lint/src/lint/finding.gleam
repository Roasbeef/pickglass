/// The rules that ship at error level rather than at warning level.

/// A rule earns the error tier by a census that is stable, decidable and
/// argued — not by being written; that is `scripts/doc_check.sh`'s staging
/// and the reason the rest warn (docs/design-notes/four-decisions.md, D2).
/// R6 is the one rule whose census was zero on the day it was written and
/// whose entire purpose is to keep it zero, which is precisely the
/// condition under which promotion cannot fail correct code. Shipping it as
/// a warning would file it among two hundred and sixty others and let the
/// door it guards close unnoticed — which is the failure it exists to
/// prevent, not a milder version of it.
///
/// The other three arrived at that same condition by measurement rather
/// than by construction, so each carries its own census and its own reason
/// for staying at zero.
///
/// **R0** is zero because `glance` 7 parses every file in the tree, and it
/// is decidable in the strictest sense available here: the parser either
/// returned a module or it did not. What promotion protects is the rest of
/// this list. Every rule but R6's token half is *silent* about a file that
/// will not parse, so an unparseable file is a linter turned off for that
/// file — and at warning level nobody decided to turn it off, which is the
/// difference between an exception and an accident.
///
/// **R2** is zero at threshold 3 across all sixteen packages: no function
/// nests `case` more than three deep, which is the de-nesting sweep's one
/// verifiable result rather than a rule nothing has tested — thirty-seven
/// functions sit at exactly 3, so the threshold is a boundary the tree
/// leans on and not a ceiling far overhead. It is decidable without types,
/// on the AST, so a wide literal the formatter wrapped is not depth.
/// Promotion protects a property that is only ever lost one `case` at a
/// time, each of which reads as reasonable on the day it lands.
///
/// **R4** is zero once `policy.harness_packages` exempts `conformance`,
/// whose `src/` is a test harness that has to compile as a library; the
/// ninety findings it held were a third of the whole census and none of
/// them was signal. `panic` and `let assert` are syntax, so the rule is
/// decidable, and `lint`'s token backstop means a construct the parser
/// dropped is reported rather than assumed inert — a policy rule that goes
/// quiet on a parse gap is a hole in the policy. This is also the one rule
/// `CLAUDE.md` and gleam-style Part IV state in as many words, and until
/// now the distance between a stated rule and an enforced one was exactly
/// this promotion.
///
/// **R7 and R8 are not here and one of them never will be.** R7's census is
/// ninety, every one of them in the harness `R4` exempts, which is Part IV
/// rule 3 at nothing per cent — a rule cannot gate on a census it has never
/// once been at zero for, and fixing ninety messages is a separate change
/// from the flag that counts them. R8 over-reports by construction, the way
/// R3 does: "more than seven parameters and one caller" is a shape worth
/// looking at, never a verdict, and a linter that fails a build over a
/// shape is a linter somebody turns off.
///
/// **R10 gates; R9 and R11 warn.** The three arrived together and they did
/// not arrive at the same place, which is worth saying because two of them
/// are decidable enough that a reader will ask why not.
///
/// **R10** met the bar the way R6 did rather than the way R2 did: by being
/// driven to zero in the change that wrote it. Its census was 1137 across
/// the eighteen packages and it is **zero** now, in `src/` and in `test/`
/// alike. It is decidable without types — a line is blank or it is not —
/// and the fix is one blank line, never a change to what the code does.
///
/// What makes the promotion safe rather than brave is that the sweep was
/// *verified against the formatter*, which is the only authority that could
/// contradict this rule. `gleam format --check` passes on all eighteen
/// packages after 1137 insertions, so no finding ever asked for a blank
/// line the formatter would take away — the failure mode that would have
/// made the rule unsatisfiable. The two exemptions exist for exactly that
/// reason: a comment opening a block, and a comment between two fields of a
/// constructor, are both places `gleam format` deletes a blank line, and a
/// rule must never demand what the formatter removes.
///
/// And the property is worth a gate. It is lost the way R2's is, one
/// comment at a time, each reasonable on the day it lands, and it is
/// invisible in review because a welded comment reads fine in a diff hunk
/// that begins above it. That is what promotion protects.
///
/// **R9** is 223 and every finding is decidable: an annotation says `Bool`
/// or it does not. What it is not is *fixable* in one change. Two hundred
/// declarations is a sweep in its own right, and some of them are not this
/// repository's to make — `terminate: Bool` and `from_hook: Bool` are
/// fields of frozen Part-1 contracts, so replacing them costs a
/// `protocol-change/NNN.md` rather than an edit. Four more are irreducible
/// and always will be: `core/json`'s `Bool(value: Bool)`, `core/msgpack`'s
/// `BoolValue`, `cap/wire`'s `bool` encoder and `core/codec`'s
/// `encode_default_false` are code *about* booleans, where the type is the
/// subject rather than a flag nobody named. A rule with four permanent
/// exceptions can still gate — R4 gates with a whole package exempted —
/// but only once the exceptions are the census rather than 2% of it.
///
/// **R11** is 17, and it is the one of the three whose *threshold* is a
/// judgement rather than a fact. Eight statements is where this tree's own
/// bodies stop having paragraphs, measured, but "eight" is not decidable
/// the way "blank or not" is, and a rule whose census moves when someone
/// argues about a number should not be able to fail a build. It is R8's
/// kind of measurement with R2's kind of arithmetic; treat the number as a
/// reading rather than a verdict.
///
/// **R12 warns forever.** It reports 85 closures in the September 14 census
/// after restricting the scan to closures returned, assigned, or stored in
/// constructors. The AST can prove that each closure captures an
/// outer binding only for field access, but it carries neither inferred record
/// types nor lifetime information. Ordinary callback arguments are omitted
/// because whether a callee retains one is an interprocedural question. A
/// report can therefore name a useful projection, but it cannot prove the
/// retained value is broad or long-lived enough to cost material memory.
///
/// **R13, R14, R15 and R16 gate; R17 and R18 warn forever.** They arrived
/// together for issue #593, local orientation in a large module, and they
/// split along the line the staging always draws: four are decidable and
/// were driven to zero in the change that wrote them, and two are
/// judgements wearing a number.
///
/// **R13** was 96 on the day it was written — every hand-written module of a
/// thousand lines or more — and it is **zero** now, because each of those
/// modules gained a `//// ## Flow` spine in the same change. Whether a module
/// doc holds the heading is decidable, and so is whether a backticked name
/// in it is a function the module defines; that second half is the reason
/// to gate. A spine is prose that names code, and prose that names code goes
/// stale the day a function is renamed. At warning level a renamed function
/// leaves a spine that lies to the next reader; at error level the rename
/// fails the build until the spine is told.
///
/// **R14** was zero by construction, because no table existed before it, and
/// it is the rule whose whole purpose is the gate: a transition table whose
/// rows must equal a type's constructors is worth having only if adding a
/// state without a row fails. Nine tables exist now and each matches its
/// type. The cells stay prose, which is the half nothing can check.
///
/// **R15** was 47 across 24 modules and is zero; every fix was a pure move of
/// a type definition above the first function, verified by the compiler.
/// Which types are the state space is decided from the step function's
/// signature rather than guessed from names, so the rule needs no types to
/// be exact. The step-function table (`update`, `step`, `transition`,
/// `handle_message`, `handle`) is a judgement, but a narrow one: each name
/// was kept only after its findings in this tree were real state machines.
///
/// **R16** was two, both constants, and is zero. An import either names a
/// lowercase value from a Loom module or it does not. The rule protects what
/// a qualifier tells a reader — which domain a call belongs to — and that is
/// lost one convenient unqualified import at a time, which is the shape of
/// property this list exists to hold.
///
/// **R17 and R18 never gate.** R17 asks whether a module reads in call order,
/// and a helper shared by several callers has no single right place; its
/// census is zero at the default threshold, so it stands as a regression
/// guard on a tree that already reads entry point first. R18 asks whether a
/// short one-caller helper names a domain operation, and that is judgement
/// by definition; its 859 findings are a reading list for a reviewer, not a
/// backlog, and a module doc padded with helper names to silence it would
/// destroy what it measures.
