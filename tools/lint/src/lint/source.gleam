//// Byte offsets to line numbers, and the one token scan the linter keeps.
////
//// `glance` reports positions as byte offsets; a reader wants a line. The
//// index is built once per file and consumed in a single merged pass over
//// offset-sorted findings, so a file costs one walk rather than a search per
//// finding.
////
//// The keyword scan is the linter's only use of `glexer`. It exists for one
//// rule: R4 is a policy rule, so a `panic` the parser silently dropped would
//// be a hole in the policy rather than a missed suggestion. Scanning tokens
//// rather than raw text is what keeps it from firing on the word `panic`
//// inside a string or a comment — those lex to a single token that never
//// decomposes into the keyword. It is the same fail-closed shape
//// `codemode/vet` uses for `@external`, narrowed to the rule that needs it.
////
//// The line classification below is the other thing that lives here, and it
//// is here for the same reason the offsets are: R10 and R11 are questions
//// about *layout*, and layout is the one property `glance` throws away.
//// The parser drops comments and blank lines entirely — a formatter-shaped
//// AST cannot tell you whether two statements were written as one paragraph
//// or two — so the rules that ask about stanzas have to read the file as
//// text alongside the tree. Classifying once per file, into a table both
//// rules index, is what keeps that from becoming a scan per statement.
