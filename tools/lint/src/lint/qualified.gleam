//// R16, unqualified imports of functions from Loom's own modules (issue #593, 3).
////
//// In a large module the qualifier is the closest thing Gleam has to a method
//// receiver. `approval.project(view)` says which domain the call belongs to
//// and where to look for it; a bare `project(view)` could be a local helper,
//// a sibling, or an import from anywhere, and the reader has to scroll to the
//// import list to find out. Types and constructors are exempt, since they
//// read as nouns and a qualifier on every `Ok`-like constructor is noise.
////
//// The rule is decidable from the import list alone. An import is Loom's own
//// when its first path segment is one of `loom_roots`; each lowercase name in
//// its `{...}` list is a function or constant and is a finding unless
//// `allowed` lists the pair. Standard-library and third-party modules are
//// outside the rule because their qualifiers are not Loom's domains.

/// The first path segment of every module this tree defines: one per
/// directory or top-level `.gleam` file under a package's `src/`, so `tui`
/// covers both `tui.gleam` and `tui/`.
///
/// The list is data and a test keeps it honest by reading `packages/` and
/// comparing. It is a list of *roots* rather than of modules because every
/// package puts its modules under one root named for it. The one place a root
/// could collide with a dependency is the MCP SDK, and it does not: the SDK
/// is `gleam_mcp` and its modules live under `gleam_mcp/`, while this tree's
/// `mcp` package owns `mcp/` alone. No other dependency defines a module under
/// any of these roots, so the whole root is listed rather than module paths.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```gleam
/// list.contains(qualified.loom_roots(), "pickglass")
/// // -> True
