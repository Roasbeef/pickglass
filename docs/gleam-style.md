*This guide distills conventions observed across the official `gleam-lang`
repositories (stdlib, otp, erlang, json, http, gleeunit, the language tour,
and the official [conventions, patterns, and anti-patterns
document](https://gleam.run/documentation/conventions-patterns-and-anti-patterns/))
into the house style for Pickglass. Gleam
is a new language for most contributors, so Part I is a compact feature tour;
Parts II–III are the style and idiom rules; Part IV is Pickglass policy
layered on top (Loom's normative version is §0.2 of its
[implementation spec](https://github.com/Roasbeef/loom/blob/main/docs/loom-implementation-spec.md)).*

`make lint` runs the house rules in `tools/lint` and is part of
`make check`. Run it after a style change; errors gate the build and
warnings remain review evidence. That package's `CLAUDE.md` records each
rule's scope and promotion history.

## Part I — A brief tour of the language

Gleam is a small, statically typed, immutable, expression-based language that
compiles to Erlang (our target) and JavaScript. The fastest way to build the
right mental model is by what it deliberately **does not have**:

- **No loops.** Iteration is recursion, almost always via `gleam/list`
  functions (`map`, `filter`, `fold`, …).
- **No `if`/`else`.** All flow control is `case` pattern matching, with
  compiler-checked exhaustiveness.
- **No early return.** Everything is an expression; a function's value is its
  last expression.
- **No null.** `Nil` is a unit type, not a member of other types. Absence is
  modeled with `Option(a)`.
- **No exceptions.** Fallible functions return `Result(a, e)` and the
  compiler forces callers to handle both cases.
- **No mutation.** Rebinding with `let` shadows; it never mutates. Records,
  lists, and dicts are persistent data structures.
- **No overloading, no macros, no type classes, no OOP, no reflection.**
  First-class functions and pattern matching are the whole toolkit. (In Loom the
  no-reflection property is load-bearing for its code-mode security model.)

### Bindings, blocks, and expressions

```gleam
let x = "Original"
let x = "New"          // rebinding shadows; nothing was mutated
let _ignored = 1000    // leading underscore silences unused warnings

let celsius = { fahrenheit - 32 } * 5 / 9   // blocks group; last expr is the value
```

Type annotations on `let` are legal but unidiomatic — annotate functions, not
bindings.

### Numbers, strings, bools

Operators are not overloaded: `Int` uses `+ - * / %`, `Float` uses
`+. -. *. /.` and `>.`-style comparisons. `<>` concatenates strings. Use
underscores in long literals: `1_000_000`. On the Erlang target integers are
arbitrary precision; division by zero is defined as zero (stdlib offers
`Result`-returning alternatives). `&&`/`||` short-circuit.

### Lists and tuples

`List(a)` is an immutable singly-linked list: prepending (`[x, ..rest]`) is
cheap; indexing is not — if you need random access, a list is the wrong
structure. Tuples `#(1, 2.2, "three")` are for quick ad-hoc grouping; reach
for a named record once a tuple crosses a function boundary or grows past two
or three elements.

### Custom types and records

```gleam
pub type SchoolPerson {
  Teacher(name: String, subject: String)
  Student(name: String)
}

let teacher = Teacher(name: "Ms Doe", subject: "ICT")
let renamed = Teacher(..teacher, name: "Ms Ray")   // record update: a new value
```

A single-variant custom type whose variant shares the type's name is Gleam's
struct. Field access via `record.name` works across variants only when the
field has the same name, position, and type in every variant; otherwise
pattern-match first. Type parameters are lowercase names:
`pub type Option(inner) { Some(inner) None }`.

### Pattern matching

`case` is the only conditional, and its exhaustiveness checking is the
language's headline refactoring tool:

```gleam
case lists, limit {
  [], _ -> []
  [first, ..] , l if first > l -> [first]     // guards: no function calls allowed
  [_, ..rest], l -> search(rest, l)
}
```

Patterns compose: multiple subjects (`case x, y`), alternatives
(`2 | 4 | 6 -> ...`), aliases (`[_, ..] as pair`), string prefixes
(`"Hello, " <> name -> ...`), list shapes (`[_, _, ..]`), and bit arrays
(`<<len:size(16), rest:bits>>`).

### Recursion and tail calls

Loops are written as recursion with an accumulator; the tail-recursive worker
is a private function suffixed `_loop`, and the accumulator never leaks into
the public signature:

```gleam
pub fn factorial(x: Int) -> Int {
  factorial_loop(x, 1)
}

fn factorial_loop(x: Int, accumulator: Int) -> Int {
  case x {
    0 | 1 -> accumulator
    _ -> factorial_loop(x - 1, accumulator * x)
  }
}
```

### Result, Option, Nil

`Result(a, e)` is the error channel; `Option(a)` is a data-modeling type.
The official policy (from the stdlib's own docs): **all fallible functions
return `Result`** — `Nil` as the error when there is nothing to say — and
`Option` is only for optional values in arguments and data structures.

```gleam
pub type PurchaseError {
  NotEnoughMoney(required: Int)
  NotLuckyEnough
}

fn buy_pastry(money: Int) -> Result(Int, PurchaseError) {
  case money >= 5 {
    True -> Ok(money - 5)
    False -> Error(NotEnoughMoney(required: 5))
  }
}
```

### `use` expressions

`use` is sugar for passing the rest of the block as a final-argument
callback. It is how Gleam recovers flat, readable error propagation without
exceptions or early returns:

```gleam
pub fn log_in() -> Result(String, Nil) {
  use username <- result.try(get_username())
  use password <- result.try(get_password())
  use greeting <- result.map(authenticate(username, password))
  greeting <> ", " <> username
}
```

Everything below a `use` line becomes `fn(username) { ... }` passed to
`result.try`. The same mechanism powers `bool.guard` (early-exit),
`decode.field` (decoders), and resource-scoping helpers. Overuse hurts
clarity: keep the right-hand side a simple call, and prefer a plain function
call when `use` buys no indentation.

### Labelled arguments

Labels make call sites read as prose, cost nothing at runtime, and may be
reordered or omitted:

```gleam
pub fn fold(over list: List(a), from initial: acc, with fun: fn(acc, a) -> acc) -> acc

list.fold(over: items, from: 0, with: int.add)
```

The shorthand `Cat(name:, lives:)` punning collapses `name: name` — used
heavily in both construction and destructuring (`let Request(headers:, ..)`).

### Opaque types

`pub opaque type` exports the type but not its constructors, so invariants
can be enforced by smart constructors — the module boundary becomes a proof
boundary:

```gleam
pub opaque type PositiveInt {
  PositiveInt(inner: Int)
}

pub fn new(i: Int) -> PositiveInt {
  case i >= 0 {
    True -> PositiveInt(i)
    False -> PositiveInt(0)
  }
}
```

### The crash ladder

Four escalating crash mechanisms, all supporting `as "message"`, all
discouraged outside their niche:

| Construct | Meaning | Where it's acceptable |
|---|---|---|
| `todo` | unfinished code (compiler warns) | during development only |
| `panic` | "this is unreachable" | almost never; prefer types that make the state impossible |
| `let assert Ok(x) = ...` | partial pattern, crash on mismatch | tests; documented invariants |
| `assert expr` | boolean check, crash on `False` | test code |

### Externals and targets

`@external(erlang, "module", "function")` binds a Gleam signature to foreign
code; the annotation is trusted unchecked, so FFI is the one place where the
type system takes your word for it. External types
(`pub type Pid` with no constructors) name foreign values without exposing
structure. A function can carry an external for one target and a Gleam body
as the fallback for the other. Details and house rules in Part III.

---

## Part II — Code style

### Formatting

`gleam format` is canonical and has no configuration. All code is formatted;
CI runs `gleam format --check`. Never hand-align anything; never argue with
the formatter. Build with `--warnings-as-errors` in CI; no warnings in
committed code.

### Naming

The compiler enforces `snake_case` for values/functions/modules and
`PascalCase` for types and constructors. On top of that, the official
conventions:

- **Write names in full.** `capacity`, not `cap`; `process_data(session)`,
  not `proc_dat(ss)`. The ecosystem uses full words even for long names
  (`absolute_value`, `exclusive_or`).
- **Acronyms are single words**: `Json`, `parse_http` — never `JSON`.
- **Module names are singular** (`core/register`, not `core/registers`), one
  concept per module, path segments included.
- **No design-pattern or category-theory names.** `monadic_bind`,
  `app/utilities`, `Monoid` — all officially called out as anti-patterns.
  Name things for the domain.

The stdlib's verb vocabulary is consistent enough to treat as a contract —
reuse it rather than inventing synonyms:

| Name shape | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `map` | transform the inner value(s) | `list.map`, `result.map` |
| `try` / `try_*` | same, but the callback is fallible and short-circuits | `result.try`, `list.try_map`, `list.try_fold` |
| `fold` | accumulate; callback is `fn(acc, a) -> acc`, accumulator first | `list.fold`, `list.index_fold` |
| `each` | side effects, returns `Nil` | `list.each` |
| `filter_map` | keep the `Ok`s | `list.filter_map` |
| `is_*` | predicate | `is_empty`, `is_ok` |
| `to_*` / `from_*` | conversion | `to_string`, `from_list` |
| `x_to_y` | conversion when both ends need naming | `method_to_string` |
| `parse_*` | fallible from-string | `parse_method` |
| `lazy_*` | thunk instead of eager value | `lazy_unwrap`, `lazy_guard` |
| `new` | empty/default constructor | `dict.new`, `request.new` |
| `*_loop` | private tail-recursive worker | `map_loop`, `parse_body_loop` |
| `do_*` | private per-target or arg-order-adapting impl | `do_insert`, `do_parse` |
| `*_forever` | infinite-timeout variant | `receive_forever`, `call_forever` |

Drop redundant type prefixes when the module carries the type's name:
`identifier.to_string`, never `identifier.identifier_to_string`. Getters
have no `get_` prefix unless paired with a `set_` (`get_header`/`set_header`).

### Module organization

- **Do not prematurely split modules.** Large modules are not a problem; the
  official conventions doc explicitly warns that fragmenting into
  `client`/`config`/`error`/`types` modules is an anti-pattern "especially
  common with AI-generated code." Split by business domain
  (`storage/sqlite`, `runtime/strand`), never by kind (`core/types`,
  `core/helpers`).
- All modules live under the package's namespace directory
  (`src/core.gleam` + `src/core/...`); never place modules in
  another package's namespace.
- Code that must be `pub` for testing but is not API goes in
  `internal` modules (the default `internal_modules` glob covers
  `$PACKAGE/internal[/*]`), or is marked `@internal`.
- Three source directories with strict roles: `src` (may import only
  dependencies and `src`), `test`, and `dev` (both may import anything).
- Tool configuration lives in `gleam.toml` under `[tools.*]`, not in
  standalone config files.

### Imports

Functions and constants are used **qualified** (`list.reverse`, not
`import gleam/list.{reverse}`). Types are commonly imported unqualified with
the `type` keyword, along with ubiquitous constructors:

```gleam
import gleam/erlang/process.{type Pid, type Subject}
import gleam/option.{type Option, None, Some}
import gleam/otp/static_supervisor.{type Supervisor} as supervisor
```

Module aliasing (`as supervisor`) is fine when it improves call sites.

### Type annotations

Annotate **all module functions** — arguments and return type, private
functions included (the stdlib annotates its `_loop` workers too). Do not
annotate `let` bindings.

### Doc comments

`////` for module docs at the top of the file; `///` on every public
function, type, and even individual record fields and variants. Function
docs use an `## Examples` section (plural, even for one), each example in
its own fenced block, calling the function module-qualified, written as a
runnable `assert`:

```gleam
/// Returns the first element of a list, if there is one.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```gleam
/// assert list.first([]) == Error(Nil)
/// ```
///
/// ```gleam
/// assert list.first([0]) == Ok(0)
/// ```
///
pub fn first(list: List(a)) -> Result(a, Nil)
```

For side-effecting or nondeterministic examples, use the `// -> result`
comment convention instead of `assert`. Docs also state complexity and
per-target behavior where relevant ("runs in linear time", "constant time on
Erlang, linear on JavaScript"), and every function that can panic documents
it under a `# Panics` heading. Module docs may be long-form tutorials —
`gleam/otp/actor` and `gleam/dynamic/decode` both carry ~150+ line worked
examples, and the otp repo compiles its module-doc example as a real test.

Lead documentation with the contract a caller cannot recover from the type
signature alone. For a process or effect boundary, answer three questions in
this order:

1. **Why does this boundary exist?** Name the race, failure domain, security
   property, or ownership rule which requires it.
2. **How does it preserve that property?** Describe the message order, state
   transition, supervision relationship, or durable write that carries the
   invariant.
3. **What may the caller rely on?** State the acknowledgement, terminal state,
   error meaning, and any work which can remain after return.

The name and signature already say what values move. A comment which stops at
"starts a worker" or "returns a result" has not documented the API.

### Plain comments: the literate register

Comment liberally, in a literate register. The reader of a module
should be able to follow the *story* of the code from its comments alone:
long modules open sections with a short banner comment saying what the
section owns; non-obvious function bodies open with a sentence or two of
prose stating the mechanism and why it is shaped that way; `case` arms in
intricate logic carry the reasoning for the arm, not a restatement of it.
The stdlib's merge-sort commentary and this repo's broker and hashline
modules are the register to imitate.

In particular, explain **why this operation occurs here** and **how its order
preserves the invariant**. Do not translate syntax into prose:

```gleam
// Bad: restates the next line.
// Send the permit to the worker.
process.send(worker, Begin)

// Good: records the ordering fact a maintainer must preserve.
// Publication transfers restart custody. The worker may enter the provider
// only after that acknowledgement, or a crash can orphan native work.
process.send(worker, Begin)
```

For a multi-process protocol, narrate the handoffs at both ends. The sender's
comment says what ownership or ordering it transfers; the receiver's comment
says what is now safe to do. For a timeout, say separately whether the caller
stops waiting, the queued job is withdrawn, the running work is cancelled, and
which event proves the work is gone. "Timed out" alone answers none of those
questions.

Density has a direction, not a cap: every place where a reader would
otherwise reconstruct intent from the code deserves prose, and invariants
that live in another module's doc comment deserve a cross-reference at the
site that relies on them. The old discipline still holds underneath — a
comment that restates the next line is noise, and a wrong comment is worse
than none, so comments state what the author verified, never what they
hoped. `//` comments go on the line before the item, never trailing.

Where the prose *sits* is the next section: a comment inside a function
body always has a blank line above it, which is a rule about layout rather
than about wording and is the one R10 checks.

### Stanzas: how code breathes

A function body is prose, so give it paragraphs. Two rules, both
mechanical, both linted.

**A comment has a blank line above it.** Not a suggestion — lint R10
**gates**, so a welded comment fails the build. The blank line is what
turns the comment from a footnote on the line above into the heading of
the stanza below, and the difference is the whole of whether a reader
scanning a four-hundred-line module can find the part they need. It
applies in three places: between the statements of a body, between the
arms of a `case`, and between the variants of a custom type. Compare:

```gleam
// Wrong: the comment is welded to the line above it, so it reads as a
// note about `let cell` and the reader has to work out that it is not.
let cell = Lineage(strand: name, parent: caller.strand, reaped: False)
// Before the lineage cell, not after: the replay path keys on the lineage
// cell and returns early when it finds one.
use Nil <- result.try(write_result_schema(config, cell))

// Right: the blank line makes it a heading, and the eye can skip between
// headings without reading the code between them.
let cell = Lineage(strand: name, parent: caller.strand, reaped: False)

// Before the lineage cell, not after: the replay path keys on the lineage
// cell and returns early when it finds one.
use Nil <- result.try(write_result_schema(config, cell))
```

The variants of a custom type are where most of this tree's `///` prose
lives, and they were 720 of the rule's original 1137 findings:

```gleam
// Wrong: a wall of variants where nothing separates one paragraph of
// documentation from the next.
pub type RegisterNs {
  /// Key: strand name → `Option(EntryId)`, the strand's current leaf.
  StrandLeaf
  /// Key: strand name → `StrandConfiguration`.
  StrandConfig
}

// Right.
pub type RegisterNs {
  /// Key: strand name → `Option(EntryId)`, the strand's current leaf.
  StrandLeaf

  /// Key: strand name → `StrandConfiguration`.
  StrandConfig
}
```

**The exemptions are the formatter's decision, not a matter of taste, and
there are two.** A comment that is the **first line of a block** cannot
have a blank line above it, because `gleam format` deletes one at the top
of a function body or a `case`. And a comment between two **fields of a
constructor** cannot either — the formatter deletes that one too, which is
the sharp edge here, because it *preserves* the same blank line between
two variants of the same type:

```gleam
pub type Finding {
  Finding(
    /// Which rule fired.
    rule: Rule,
    /// No blank line here: `gleam format` would delete it.
    path: String,
  )
}
```

So the rule reaches variants and not fields. If you are ever unsure
whether a blank line survives somewhere, do not guess — `gleam format
--stdin < probe.gleam` answers in a second, and that is how both of these
were settled.

**A body does not run more than about eight statements without a break.**
A blank line or a comment, either counts — a paragraph break is a
paragraph break. The reason is not aesthetic: a body with no paragraphs
has nowhere to put the prose the section above asks for, so density and
silence arrive together. `runtime/supervisor.start` was ten `let`s in a
wall and reads as three stanzas once broken — the names, the strand
template, the factory — with one line of prose over each.

Two things deliberately do **not** count as density, and both are the same
distinction R2 makes about nesting:

- **A wrapped literal is one statement.** `gleam format` gives a wide call
  one argument per line, so a thirty-line `json.Object([..])` looks dense
  to a line counter and is a single step. Count statements, never lines,
  and do not break a data literal into paragraphs — a comment naming one
  element of one belongs directly above that element, with no blank line
  owed.
- **A `use` chain is a table, not a paragraph.** `core/codec`'s
  `decode_assistant_message` is nineteen `use field <- result.try(…)`
  lines with nothing between them and it is exactly right; breaking it at
  an arbitrary field would make it worse. `use` bindings carry a run
  across without lengthening it, so ten `let`s threaded through a decoder
  chain still read as ten.

Likewise `case` arms are a table. Twelve one-line arms dispatching a
message type want no blank lines at all — but a comment giving the
*reasoning* for an arm still wants one above it, which is the first rule
arriving in the second place.

### What the formatter decides, and what you do

`gleam format` gives a call or signature exactly two layouts: everything
on one line when the whole form fits in 80 columns, otherwise one
argument per line. There is no packed middle mode and no configuration,
so the vertical cost of a wide call is the formatter's canon — do not
fight it, and do not hand-pack arguments; the gate would reject it.
The one honest lever is writing forms that fit: drop call-site labels
that add width without disambiguating (stdlib practice), name
intermediates so the call takes short references, and split a function
whose signature cannot fit rather than living with a tall one. Never
trade clarity for a saved line.

### Orientation in large modules

Stanzas orient a reader inside one body. This section orients a reader
inside one *module*, and it is a rule about layout rather than about any
single function, which is why it sits beside the stanza rules and not in
Part III. The reader it serves arrives from "go to definition" or a search
hit, lands in the middle of a two-thousand-line file, and has not read the
module doc, the types or the function above. Small bodies and prose over
every stanza keep each function readable, but they do not tell that reader
where the function sits in the whole. Six rules do, and they are cheap to
follow because they ask for what the author already knows. They came out
of an outside read of the tree ([issue
#593](https://github.com/Roasbeef/loom/issues/593)), and the
language-server modules were the first written this way, so their module
docs are good second examples beside the two below.

| # | Rule | Lint | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A large module opens with a flow spine | R13 | gates |
| 2 | Functions follow the call flow | R17 | census |
| 3 | Domain functions are called qualified | R16 | gates |
| 4 | A helper is extracted only if it names a domain operation | R18 | census |
| 5 | State, message and effect types come before the first function | R15 | gates |
| 6 | A critical state machine carries a checked transition table | R14 | gates |

R13, R14, R15 and R16 are decidable without judgement, so they gate once
the tree is clean. R17 and R18 never gate: they are censuses that warn
forever. A helper shared by several callers has no single right place
(R17), and whether a name is a domain operation is a judgement that a
program can only approximate (R18). Read their warnings as a prompt to
look, as you read R8's.

**1. Open a large module with a flow spine.** A module of a thousand lines
or more (`policy.spine_lines`) carries a `//// ## Flow` section in its
module doc, after the paragraphs that say why the module exists. The
section runs to the next `#` or `##` heading, so put it before the deeper
sections rather than above a paragraph it would swallow. The spine is one
arrow line naming the main path, then a numbered
list saying what each step does, in the order a reader meets the steps. It
runs ten to twenty lines. It shows the main road and leaves the detail to
the doc comment on each function. This is `tui/inbound`'s:

```gleam
//// ## Flow
////
//// `drain_connection` → `handle_connection_message` → `apply_channel_update`
//// → `run_settled` → `settle_surfaces` → `show_surface`
////
//// 1. `drain_connection` takes a batch from the adopted inbox with
////    `take_connection` and records whether it stopped at the batch.
//// 2. `handle_connection_message` gives one message to the session channel
////    through `lane_fold.receive`, which answers with channel updates.
//// 3. `tick_channel` is the timer's way in: `lane_fold.tick` yields the same
////    updates when a deadline or the idle refresh falls due.
//// 4. `apply_channel_update` reads `surroundings`, then folds one update
////    through `run_settled`, which holds the result and settles it.
//// 5. `settle_surfaces` replays each recorded fact through `show_surface`,
////    then `restore_returned_drafts` moves returned drafts to the editors.
//// 6. `show_surface` writes one fact to the terminal; a lost connection ends
////    in `begin_reconnect`, which asks `reconnect_decision` if one is owed.
```

A path with branches reads better drawn than listed, and a spine may be a
diagram in a ```` ```text ```` fence instead. `client/lsp/manager`'s traces
a path-scoped query from `door` through the keeper to the answer, with the
bare-name, write and shutdown paths beside it:

```gleam
//// ```text
//// door → definition | references | hover | outline | calls
//// a path-scoped query:
////   session_for → owned → acquire → ask(Acquire) → handle
////     → begin → start_keeper → keep_server → begin_server
////     → backend.connect (jailed: connect_jailed → jail_for → probe)
//// ```
```

The lint checks the names, which keeps a spine from rotting the way a
paragraph would. Every backticked snake_case name in the section must be a
function defined in the module, and `alias.name` must use an alias the
module imports (`lane_fold.receive` above; the function behind it is not
checked). A spine names at least three local functions and holds no fenced
code block, which would hide names from the check. Anything else in
backticks, such as a type or a constructor, is prose and is left alone.
That includes a quoted literal, which is how a spine names a wire field:
`settle` runs on `"message_stop"`, not on `message_stop`, which the lint
would read as a function the module lacks. A parameter, a field or a
constant is not a function either, so write it as a plain word.
Inside a `text` diagram there are no backticks to say which words are
names, so the check goes by shape. A word with an interior underscore
(`begin_server`) or written as a call (`ask(Acquire)`) must be a function
or a constant of the module, because prose has no such words. A plain
word (`door`, `handle`) is not checked, though it counts towards the three
when it is a function. A qualified word (`backend.connect`) is not checked
in a diagram, where it is as often a field call as an import, and a
pattern such as `decode_<name>` or `render_*` names a family. Any fence
that is not `text` is a code listing and is refused.
Rename a function and the build fails until the spine follows. A smaller
module may carry a spine too, and it is checked the same way. R13 gates.

**2. Order a large file by call flow.** Put an entry point above the
helpers it calls, and the helpers in the order the entry point reaches
them, so that reading downward follows the spine. A reader who has just
read `receive` then finds `apply_pushed` and `apply_reply` below it, and
not eleven screens away beside whatever they share a prefix with. Gleam
does not care about definition order, so the order is yours to give. R17
counts a module's private helpers that sit above their first caller, and
warns when a module has ten or more helpers and more than half of them are
out of order. The tree reads entry point first today, so the census is zero
and the rule stands guard over that. It is a census because a helper called from five places has no
single right position, and moving one to please the count would hurt four
callers to help one.

**3. Call domain functions qualified.** Import a Pickglass module and write
`session_channel.tick(...)`, not
`import session_view/session_channel.{tick}` and a bare `tick(...)`. This
is the Imports rule above, enforced for Pickglass modules. A bare `tick` or
`apply` in the middle of a body could be this module's own function or
another's, and the reader dropped in from "go to definition" answers that
by scrolling to the imports. Qualified, `lane_fold.apply_channel_update`
names the module that owns the step without leaving the line. R16 flags an
unqualified import of a Pickglass function and gates.

The rule reaches only Pickglass's own modules, those whose first path segment
is a package root under `packages/*/src` (`qualified.loom_roots`, the
vendored lint's name for the list, which a test holds to the tree). The standard library and dependencies follow the
Imports section above, where `type Option, None, Some` stay unqualified.
Types and constructors are never findings, because a constructor names
itself, and neither is a type. Qualification is not free, so the rule also
has an allow list (`qualified.allowed`) for a Pickglass function whose bare name
reads better, the way a `use <- or_fault(...)` continuation combinator
might. In Loom it is empty: the tree held two unqualified values, both
constants, and both read better qualified. What the rule refuses is the
call a reader cannot place, a function that does domain work.

```gleam
// Bad: `tick` and `receive` could be this module's, or anyone's.
import session_view/session_channel.{receive, tick}

let #(lane, updates) = receive(lane, message, now:)

// Good: the module that owns the transition is on the line.
import session_view/session_channel

let #(lane, updates) = session_channel.receive(lane, message, now:)
```

**4. Extract a helper only if its name is a domain operation.** A helper
earns its place by naming a step of the domain: `settle_cache`,
`apply_submission` and `capture_again` each say what changes when they run,
so the reader of the caller can skip the body because the name is the
summary. `do_thing2`, `helper` and `process_inner` name only where the
author cut the function. They add a jump without a meaning, and the reader
pays the jump to learn that the body is no more than the lines the caller
lost. When you cannot name the extracted piece as an operation, it is
probably not one, and the better change is a stanza break and a comment
inside the caller.

This complements R8 and does not repeat it. R8 looks at the shape of a
one-caller function wide enough to be a pyramid moved elsewhere. R18 looks
at the name of a small one: a private function with exactly one caller,
spanning six lines or fewer (`policy.unnamed_helper_lines`), whose name the
module doc never mentions. A helper the module doc names has been promoted
to part of the module's story by the one reader entitled to say so. Both
warn and neither is a reason to inline by itself, because naming a domain
operation is a judgement. Never add helper names to a module doc to quiet
R18: that defeats the only signal it gives.

**5. Put the state, message and effect types first.** In a module that is
a state machine (a reducer, a channel, a supervisor loop), define its
custom types above its first function. A reader of a transition needs the
states before the transitions, and "go to definition" on a constructor
should land near the top and not at line 1,100. The move is free because
Gleam resolves types in any order. R15 decides which module is a state
machine and which types are its state space without guessing from names: a
module that defines a step function (`update`, `step`, `transition`,
`handle_message` or `handle`, the table in `state_first.step_names`) is
one, and the local types its signature names, through type arguments,
tuples and function types, are the state space. Each must be defined above
the first function. R15 gates.
`tui/inbound` defined `ReconnectDecision` after the function that returns
it; the fix was a pure move above `reconnect_decision`.

**6. Give a critical state machine a checked transition table.** A
function that dispatches on a state type shows what happens in each case
but never lets the reader see one state whole. A table does: one row per
state, one column per event. For the machines whose misuse costs the most,
put the table in the module doc under a marker that names the type, and
the lint holds it to the code. This is a part of `session_view/session_channel`'s,
whose `Phase` has five states:

```gleam
//// <!-- transitions: session_channel.Phase -->
////
//// | state | receive | tick | submit | close | retire |
//// | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//// | `AwaitingBegin` | `Receiving` on a valid begin; `Ready` on a resumed marker; a push is applied in place; anything else `Closed` | `Closed` once the deadline passes | queued (`Waiting`); a mutation also needs a held cut and a mutating role, else refused | `Closed` | `Closed` |
//// | `Closed` | ignored | nothing | refused | unchanged | unchanged |
```

The marker names `module.Type`, where `module` is the last path segment
or the full path, and the type must be a custom type defined in the
module. The body rows must name exactly the type's variants: a missing,
extra or duplicated row fails, as does a row whose cell count differs from
the header's and an empty cell. So adding a variant to `Phase` fails the
build until someone decides what every event does to it, which is the
decision the table exists to force. The cells are prose: name the next
state, say "refused" or "ignored", and add a few words where the answer
depends on something. The lint checks the shape and not the claims, so
derive the table from the code with the code open, and read it against the
model where one exists. R14 gates.

### Deprecation

`@deprecated("Use x instead")` with a message that names the replacement;
deprecate for a release cycle, then remove.

## Part III — Idiomatic Gleam

### Error handling

- **`Result` for everything fallible; `Option` never signals failure.**
  `Result(a, Nil)` is the default when the caller needs no explanation
  (`list.first`, `dict.get`, `int.parse` all return it). Introduce an error
  ADT only when callers genuinely branch on the cause.
- **Design descriptive errors.** Variants named for the domain failure, each
  carrying context: `NoteCouldNotBeRead(path: String, reason: FileError)`.
  Wrapping a dependency's raw error as your entire error type is an
  anti-pattern.
- **Chain with `use` + `result.try`/`result.map`**, `bool.guard` for early
  exits (`use <- bool.guard(when: input == "", return: Error(Nil))` — note
  that `return:` there is a constant, which is the only kind of argument the
  eager form should carry). Nested `case` on `Result`s is a smell; `case` is
  for ADT dispatch. This one rule is worth five sections on its own, below:
  it is the rule this codebase has broken most often, and the guards that
  fix it have a hazard of their own.
- **Never check-then-assert** (`result.is_ok` followed by
  `let assert Ok(..)`) — pattern match once.
- **Avoid catch-all `_ ->` patterns.** Exhaustiveness checking is how the
  compiler finds every site affected by a new variant; a catch-all disables
  it. Match variants explicitly unless the type is genuinely open-ended.
- **Libraries must not panic.** `panic`/`let assert` in library code is
  reserved for documented invariant violations where crashing the process is
  the design (OTP supervision absorbs it) — and then always with an
  `as "message"` explaining the invariant:

```gleam
let assert Ok(pid) = named(name) as "Sending to unregistered name"
```

### Flattening nested `case`

The bullet above is the most under-applied rule in this guide, so it gets
sections of its own. A sweep across every package flattened the tree from
6067 lines sitting ten or more columns in to 3156 — a 48% cut — and almost
none of it was restructuring. It was chains written where staircases had
grown.

The shape to recognize: a `case` whose error arm is one line and whose
success arm swallows the rest of the function into another level of
indentation. That is a `use` line pretending to be a block. When both sides
are `Result`, `result.try` and `result.map` take it directly; when they are
not, the file writes a small combinator (see below) rather than accepting
the pyramid. `core/json.gleam` went from 134 deep lines to 44 this way, and
`machine/planner.gleam` from 786 to 412, without a single behavioural
change between them.

**Depth from data is not a pyramid.** `gleam format` gives a wide call one
argument per line, so a nested `json.Object([#("k", json.Array(...))])`
indents as far as any staircase and means nothing of the kind.
`client/protocol.gleam` and `machine/codec.gleam` both read as deep to any
indentation census and neither contains a pyramid: every deep line in them
is inside a literal the formatter wrapped. Both were left entirely alone by
the sweep, deliberately. Do not "fix" the formatter, and do not let a depth
metric send you into an encoder.

The converse also matters: extracting a helper just to shorten a wrapped
argument list can make the indentation census better and the file longer.
Count the parameters before extracting. If a helper needs more than three
or four threaded values, consider passing the record they came from;
otherwise the two call blocks may cost more than the body they replace.
Lint R8 measures wide one-caller helpers, but its census is a prompt to
read the code, not a reason to extract or bundle by itself.

**Never flatten at the cost of exhaustiveness.** This is the catch-all rule
above, arriving from the other direction: collapsing two nested matches into
one often means writing a final arm that is a bare variable, and a bare
variable is a catch-all whatever you call it. `session/session.gleam`'s
`heal_loop` keeps its two levels — an outer match on the list, an inner one
on the message — for exactly this reason. Collapsed, the second level's
three explicitly named variants (`UserMessage`, `ToolResultMessage`,
`CustomMessage`) become `[message, ..rest] ->`, and the day a fourth message
variant is added the compiler says nothing. Two levels and a working
exhaustiveness check beat one level and a silent hole; the check is the
whole reason we match variants by name.

### Eager arguments: `return:`, replacements, and fallbacks

`bool.guard` is a function, not syntax. So is `result.replace_error`, and so
are `result.unwrap` and `option.unwrap`. Gleam evaluates call arguments
eagerly, which means **`return:`, the replacement error, and the fallback
value are all computed on every call, whether or not the branch that uses
them is taken.**

This is a correctness hazard when the argument recurses. Three sites in
three packages hit it independently and all three stayed plain `case`
expressions:

- `provider/stream.gleam`'s `run_loop` — the chunk arm's `None` branch
  recurses into `run_loop`, so `option.unwrap(forward(events, deliver),
  run_loop(..))` would recurse unconditionally, even on a stream that has
  already terminated.
- `tools/blob.gleam`'s `utf8_slice_at`, which retries with a shorter range
  when a cut lands mid-character.
- `tools/fs.gleam`'s `walk_segment`, whose missing-path arm recurses into
  `walk_loop`.

It is a performance hazard when the argument is merely expensive, and that
is how we shipped a quadratic JSON parser. Flattening `core/json.gleam` left
the string-body guard in the eager form:

```gleam
// Wrong: `fail` runs once per character parsed, not once per failure.
use <- bool.guard(
  when: code < 0x20,
  return: Error(fail(cursor, "control characters to be escaped in a string")),
)
```

`fail` builds a `CorruptionReport`, a report carries `excerpt(cursor.rest)`,
and `excerpt` ended with `list.length(rest) > 24` — a walk of all remaining
input. So every character of every string in a document paid for two reports
over the rest of that document, on the happy path, where nothing had gone
wrong at all. The fix is the lazy counterpart plus a length test that stops
where the question does:

```gleam
use <- bool.lazy_guard(when: code < 0x20, return: fn() {
  Error(fail(cursor, "control characters to be escaped in a string"))
})
```

— and, in `excerpt` itself, `case list.drop(rest, 24) != []`, which answers
a question about the first twenty-five elements without walking the tail.
Making the guard lazy alone would only have moved the quadratic factor off
the hot path; removing it took both.

A fifty-entry branch scan over a ten-thousand-entry chain went from 29 ms
back to 2.7 ms. Every unit test was green throughout.

**The rule.** Use the eager form only when `return:` is a value you would
happily compute anyway — a constant, or a bare constructor over data you
already have in hand. `machine/acceptance.gleam`'s `accept_navigation`
stacks five guards returning `Error(InvalidNavigation(reason: "..."))` over
string literals; that is free and the eager form is right there. If the
argument recurses, allocates, walks a list, or formats a message, reach for
`bool.lazy_guard`, `result.map_error`, `result.lazy_unwrap` /
`option.lazy_unwrap` — or leave the plain `case`, which is always correct
and sometimes clearest. The `lazy_*` row in the naming table exists for this
and is not a micro-optimisation: here it was the difference between linear
and quadratic.

The same eagerness argues against `result.try` chains in one more place.
`provider/internal/wire.gleam`'s `retry_after_ms` must not fall back from a
present-but-malformed `retry-after-ms` header to `retry-after`; absent and
invalid are different facts about the world. A chain flattens both into one
error and silently changes behaviour. Dispatch that distinguishes them stays
a `case`.

### Short-circuit combinators, and why every file grows its own

Where the two sides are not both `Result`, the house pattern is a tiny
combinator taking the fallible value first and the continuation last, so it
reads in `use` position. `machine/planner.gleam`'s `or_fault` is the
original:

```gleam
fn or_fault(
  result: Result(a, CorruptionReport),
  then: fn(a) -> Action,
) -> Action {
  case result {
    Error(report) -> Fault(report:)
    Ok(value) -> then(value)
  }
}
```

```gleam
use batch <- or_fault(plan_batch(in, message, context, entry))
```

That one function removed a two-armed `case` from a dozen sites whose error
arm was always exactly `Fault(report:)`. The lineage now runs across the
tree:

| Combinator | Source | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `machine/planner.or_fault` | `Result(a, CorruptionReport)` | `Action` |
| `machine/planner.or_fault_unless` | `Bool` + a report thunk | `Action` |
| `or_fail`, in each provider adapter | `Result(a, e)` + `to_error` | `#(Accumulator, List(StreamEvent))` |
| `provider/gateway.or_failure` | `Result(a, Nil)` + an escape thunk | `AttemptOutcome` |
| `tools/tool.or_outcome` | `Result(a, e)` + `to_outcome` | `ToolOutcome` |
| `client/gateway.or_reply` | `Result(a, #(String, String))` | `State` |
| `runtime/strand_runtime.or_continue` | `Option(a)` | `Outcome` |
| `runtime/strand_runtime.or_halt` | `Result(a, String)` | `Outcome` |
| `runtime/strand_runtime.or_key_halt` | `Result(a, String)` | `KeyResolution` |

Check the signature, not just the table: these helpers have different
arities. Every argument between the subject and the continuation is eager,
including state, accumulators and error mappers. Existing values are fine;
constructing a fallback at the call site pays for it even on success. If
the escape must build data or perform work, pass a thunk and call it only
in that arm, as `provider/gateway.or_failure` does with `on_error`.
R1's structural check follows those argument positions in local helpers.

**Say plainly what this list is: structural, not duplication.** Gleam has no
type classes, so a short-circuit combinator binds one source type and one
target type at once. There is no generic or-else to import and no way to
abstract over "the thing this function eventually returns". A file needs a
new combinator the moment it acquires a second way to escape — which is why
`strand_runtime.gleam` has three, two of them identical apart from what they
return. Write the fourth without apology. Name it `or_<what happens
instead>`, and document it with the commented `// use x <- or_fault(..)`
form, since a doctest cannot call a private function.

**Name an effectful escape for its effect.** `client/gateway.or_reply`
sends an error frame before returning the unchanged state. That belongs
in an escape helper because the name and its `use` example expose the
response. A legacy name such as `known_strand` must document that failed
lookup sends a reply; a new helper with that responsibility should name
the reply in its name. Keep `result.map_error` a pure error conversion.

**Where the lineage stops: error paths that owe cleanup.**
`broker/broker.gleam`'s clearance path fails
into *different* rollbacks depending on how far it got: a mint failure hands
back the reserved budget slot, while a helper-checkout failure hands back
the slot *and* revokes the minted token. Threading that through an error
mapper would bury two distinct pieces of state repair inside something that
looks like formatting. The tool there is named extraction — `authorize`,
`mint_token`, `checkout_helper`, one decision each, each owning its own
undo — which flattens the staircase just as well and leaves the cleanup
where a reader trips over it.

### Frictions the language imposes

Each of these came up more than once during the sweep. None has a
workaround; knowing them saves the attempt.

- **Guards cannot call functions.** A pattern guard is restricted to inline
  boolean expressions, so `Some(handle) if handle_valid(handle, ctx) ->` is
  not legal Gleam and `machine/classification.gleam`'s `classify_running`
  keeps a nested match where a guard would have flattened it.
- **`use` does not compose across a closure boundary.** `use` desugars the
  rest of *its own block*; a `list.fold` or `list.try_fold` callback is a new
  block, so a `case` inside one cannot be lifted out by a `use` in the
  enclosing function. `machine/planner.gleam`'s `plan_batch` keeps its fold
  body's match for this reason.
- **The capture shorthand takes exactly one hole.** `f(a, _, c)` is fine;
  two underscores is not a capture. A second hole means a full `fn(x, y)`.
- **`bool.guard`'s `return:` must unify with the function's eventual
  return type**, not with an early-exit type of its own. There is no bare
  early return, so each guard repeats a whole constructor —
  `accept_navigation`'s five guards are five near-identical blocks, and that
  is as small as it gets.
- **An opaque actor `Msg` taxes every handler split out of its dispatch.**
  A handler that takes the message has to re-match the variant, and outside
  the module the constructors are not available at all, so the dispatch
  destructures each variant and passes the fields on individually:
  `codemode/satellite.gleam`'s `handle` hands `handle_connected` three
  separate arguments rather than the message. Extraction is still right; it
  just is not free.

### Verifying a refactor that changes no behaviour

A behaviour-preserving refactor is not verified by unit tests alone, because
unit tests assert results and a refactor can only break *how* they are
reached. The quadratic parser above passed all 96 core tests and all 26
storage tests. What caught it was one timing assertion —
`sqlite_perf_smoke_test` in the conformance storage suite, which scans the
newest fifty entries of a ten-thousand-entry chain twenty times and asserts
the p50 against a ceiling. A green test suite and a red number is a shape to
expect from this kind of work, not a surprise.

So: after a readability pass over anything on a hot path, run the perf smoke
(`make check-conformance`), alternating control and candidate runs rather
than measuring each once, and **isolate one file**. The json regression was
misattributed to `storage/sqlite.gleam` for an hour because the control tree
was cut from a commit before the json change and the candidate carried both.
Two changes, one measurement, no answer.

And do not substitute one number for another. That same hour was spent
arguing that the control run was "more loaded" because it inserted more
slowly — but the smoke's insert phase is dominated by durable commit and its
scan phase by CPU, so insert time is no proxy for the load a scan sees. Time
the thing you are claiming got slower.

### Type design

- **Make invalid states impossible.** Prefer
  `LoggedIn(id: Int, email: String) | Guest` over
  `User(id: Option(Int), email: Option(String))`. Encode invariants in
  constructors, not in runtime checks.
- **No naked `Bool` in a parameter or a field.** See below; this is the
  house rule the rest of this list used to state as a preference.
- **Opaque types guard invariants**: anything with a validity condition
  (`Subject`, `Set`, `Decoder`) is `pub opaque type` with smart
  constructors. External types (`pub type Pid` — no constructors at all)
  name foreign values.
- **Dicts are second-class.** No literal syntax, no pattern matching, no
  ordering guarantees; custom types with named fields are the default for
  structured data.
- Type aliases add no safety and are used rarely — mostly to shorten
  recurring shapes (`pub type Header = #(String, String)`, with invariants
  documented and enforced by functions) or re-export
  (`pub type Dynamic = dynamic.Dynamic`).
- Descriptive type variables where the parameter is domain-relevant:
  `Request(body)`, `fn set_body(req: Request(old_body), body: new_body) ->
  Request(new_body)`; single letters (`a`, `e`, `k`, `v`, `acc`) elsewhere.

### No naked `Bool`

`Bool` is the one type in the language that carries no domain meaning at
all, and it is the one this tree reached for two hundred times. The rule:
**a `Bool` may not be a function parameter or a record field.** Model the
question with a two-variant type named for the domain.

```gleam
// Wrong. The call site says `render(document, True)`, which names
// nothing, and finding out what the `True` was costs a jump to the
// signature.
fn render(document: Document, compact: Bool) -> String

// Right. The call site says `render(document, Compact)`, and the two
// states cannot be got backwards.
pub type Density { Compact  Expanded }
fn render(document: Document, density: Density) -> String
```

A label helps the call site and does not settle the question: labels are
optional at the call site in Gleam, so `f(terminate: True)` and
`f(x, True)` are the same call, and neither the reader of the body nor the
reader of a `case` over the value gets anything from the label at all.

The argument is stronger for a **field** than for a parameter. `retry:
Bool` in a record makes every reader carry the polarity of the name in
their head at every construction site and every match, and it makes
`Retry | GiveUp` — which cannot be got backwards — a change to every
construction site rather than a change to one declaration. A field is
read at a greater distance from its declaration than a parameter is.

**Return position is deliberately outside the rule.** `is_empty(xs) ->
Bool` is the predicate `case`, `&&` and `bool.guard` are built to consume,
`is_*` is in the naming table above, and a function that takes a predicate
(`list.filter(xs, is_ready)`) is passing that same legitimate shape as an
argument. A function that answers a domain question with a domain type is
better where it is natural; it is not a rule, and R9 does not ask.

Three escapes, and they are narrow:

- **Code about booleans.** `core/json`'s `Bool(value: Bool)`,
  `core/msgpack`'s `BoolValue` and `cap/wire`'s `bool` encoder are the
  wire's own boolean, where the type is the subject rather than a flag
  nobody named. Four sites in the tree.
- **A frozen contract.** `terminate: Bool` and `from_hook: Bool` are
  fields of a frozen contract. Changing one is a design decision
  recorded where the contract lives, not a cleanup — so the finding stands and the
  fix waits for the proposal.
- **Interop with a foreign or stdlib signature** that is `Bool` on the
  other side. Convert at the boundary, and let the two-variant type live
  on this side of it.

`make lint` R9 counts them; the census is 223 and the rule warns, for the
reasons in `finding.error_by_default`.

### Pipelines and function values

APIs put the subject first so `|>` works; one step per line for chains of
three or more. The capture shorthand `f(x, _)` pipes into a non-first
position; use it sparingly. Pass named functions directly when arity fits
(`list.map(names, string.uppercase)`), otherwise a literal `fn(x) { ... }`.
Point-free composition is un-Gleam — the stdlib removed its `compose`/`tap`
helpers.

```gleam
string
|> string_tree.from_string
|> string_tree.reverse
|> string_tree.to_string
```

### The builder pattern

The house pattern for configurable construction, used identically by
`actor`, `static_supervisor`, and HTTP requests: an (often opaque) record,
`new` with sensible defaults, pipeable setters using record-update syntax
and label punning, and a terminal verb:

```gleam
pub fn start_supervisor() -> actor.StartResult(Supervisor) {
  supervisor.new(supervisor.OneForOne)
  |> supervisor.add(database_pool.supervised())
  |> supervisor.add(http_server.supervised())
  |> supervisor.start
}
```

Setters are two-liners: compute the new field into a `let` named after the
field, then `Request(..request, headers:)`.

### Core libraries and the sans-io pattern

Use the maintained core packages — `gleam_stdlib`, `gleam_erlang`,
`gleam_otp`, `gleam_json`, `gleam_http`, `gleam_time` — rather than
replicating what they provide; they are the ecosystem's shared foundation.
`gleam_http` also models the official **sans-io pattern** for API surfaces:
a package of pure types plus request-builder and response-parser functions,
with the actual I/O supplied by the caller. Loom's effect plane is this
pattern writ large — pure planning in a pure package, I/O only at the
edge — so prefer sans-io shapes for any protocol code.

### Decoders and encoders

JSON/dynamic decoding uses `gleam/dynamic/decode` with `use`-chained fields
ending in `decode.success` + punned construction (older
`dynamic.field` pipelines are obsolete):

```gleam
let cat_decoder = {
  use name <- decode.field("name", decode.string)
  use lives <- decode.field("lives", decode.int)
  decode.success(Cat(name:, lives:))
}
```

Encoders are plain `t -> Json` functions composed with `json.object`
tuple-lists and `json.array(items, of: encoder)`; `Option` maps to null via
`json.nullable(from: value, of: encoder)`.

### Processes, actors, supervision

Pickglass is OTP-shaped, so the `gleam_otp`/`gleam_erlang` idioms are our bread
and butter:

- **Message types: one variant per message, labelled fields, replies carry a
  `Subject`** conventionally named `reply_with:`/`reply_to:`:

```gleam
pub type Message(element) {
  Shutdown
  Push(push: element)
  Pop(reply_with: Subject(Result(element, Nil)))
}
```

- **Wrap the message API in functions.** Callers get `stack.push(subject, x)`
  and `stack.pop(subject, timeout)`, not raw message constructors. `call`
  takes the constructor partially applied:
  `process.call(subject, waiting: 100, sending: Pop)`.
- **Actors via the builder**: `actor.new(state) |> actor.on_message(handle)
  |> actor.start`; handlers are `fn(state, msg) -> actor.Next(state, msg)`
  returning `actor.continue(state)` / `actor.stop()`. Selectors merge
  differently-typed subjects (`new_selector() |> select_map(subject, Wrap)`).
- **Every startable thing exposes `start` and `supervised()`** — the latter
  returns a `ChildSpecification` for embedding in a supervision tree, and is
  the one you should normally use. Supervisors compose the same way
  (`supervisor.new(strategy) |> supervisor.add(child.supervised())`).
- **Failure philosophy is split deliberately**: `receive` returns `Result`
  (timeout is expected); `call` **panics** on timeout or callee death — a
  crashed caller under supervision beats a process in an invalid state.
  Timeouts are plain `Int` milliseconds with a labelled argument; "forever"
  is a separate function, not a magic value.
- **Process machinery is built on weft, not hand-rolled.** The idioms above
  are `gleam_otp`'s and still hold, but the process you are about to write
  is almost always one of five shapes weft already provides, and a copy of
  that shape is a review finding. A deadline-bounded spawn is a one-task
  `weft` run; an actor whose first work must run before any request uses
  `weft/actor`'s `continuing`; a process written as mutually recursive
  phase functions with a timer whose handler checks for a stale fire is a
  `weft/state_machine` (the phases are the state ADT, the timer a state
  timeout, the "not ready yet" list a `postpone`); a process that owns
  work outliving itself is a managed task whose scope is the drain
  witness; a foreground wait on a synchronous probe is `weft/poll`. The
  rules a port is held to — payloads immutable within a state, every
  `case state, message` pair written, `unlinked` when the starter must not
  share fate, children published beneath their parent — and the standing
  rejections are in `docs/weft.md`. `core` never imports it (Part IV §5).

### FFI

FFI is the guarded escape hatch — both in official guidance ("most projects
won't use any at all") and in Loom's security model, which Pickglass keeps as a discipline:

- **Design the Gleam API first**; never mirror the foreign API's shape.
  Define precise external types (`pub type ZipHandle`), **never `Dynamic`**,
  for foreign values.
- Erlang shims live in one flat `<package>_ffi.erl` module per package;
  prefer direct `@external` to stock OTP modules (`lists`, `maps`) when
  types line up. Externals still carry full Gleam signatures and labels.
- Erlang-side shims convert to Gleam conventions at the boundary: catch
  exceptions and return `{ok, X} | {error, nil}`; normalize raw terms into
  the shapes of Gleam variants.
- When an Erlang function returns a meaningless or leaky value, wrap it with
  the `DoNotLeak` idiom — the external returns a private empty type and a
  public wrapper discards it and returns `Nil`.
- Single-variant private types stand in for Erlang atoms so no atom is built
  at runtime: `type KillFlag { Kill }`.
- A `do_` wrapper adapts argument order when the foreign function isn't
  subject-first.

### Testing

- gleeunit: `test/<package>_test.gleam` has `pub fn main() {
  gleeunit.main() }`; every public function ending in `_test` anywhere under
  `test/` runs as a test. The test tree mirrors `src`.
- **Assert with the `assert` keyword** — `assert some_function() == "Hi!"` —
  not the deprecated `gleeunit/should` module. `let assert` destructures
  expected shapes (`let assert Error(json.UnexpectedByte(byte)) = result`);
  `panic as "..."` marks branches a test must not reach.
- **One small scenario per test, named for it**: `first_ok_test`,
  `from_list_duplicate_key_test`. Many micro-tests beat few mega-tests.
- Shared assertion helpers are plain local functions
  (`fn should_encode(data, expected)`); fixtures are local closures.

## Part IV — Pickglass policy

These rules are Loom's Part IV (§0.2 of its implementation spec), trimmed to
what applies here. They tighten the ecosystem defaults.

1. **Toolchain**: Gleam ≥ 1.19.0, Erlang/OTP ≥ 29. `gleam format` enforced; no
   warnings.
2. **Total decoders**: every wire or storage boundary decodes with a
   decoder that returns a `Result` carrying a report of what was wrong.
   Partial decoding is a bug class, not a style choice — parse fully or
   report the corruption. This matters more here than in most projects:
   Pickglass reads traces and runtime data it did not produce.
3. **No `panic`/`let assert` outside tests**, except documented invariant
   violations that must fault the process. A `let assert` in `src` carries
   `as "message"`. R4 enforces the first half and R7 the second; `test/`
   disables both because the test name supplies context.
4. **FFI confinement, and as little of it as possible**: `@external` only
   in `*/internal/ffi_*.gleam` modules; every external carries a comment
   naming the OTP function used and why no pure alternative exists. The
   rule is about *how much* as well as *where*: custom Erlang — a new
   `@external`, a new `.erl` file — is a last resort, taken only when
   `gleam_stdlib`, `gleam_erlang`, `gleam_otp` or weft cannot express the
   thing at all, never for convenience or speed. `core` is stricter still
   — see 5.
5. **Purity layering**: `core`, the pure package Pickglass will grow, holds
   **no `@external` of any target, and no `gleam_erlang` or `gleam_otp`**,
   in source or in `gleam.toml`. Effects live in the packages that host
   them; `core` decides, and never acts. This is a rule, not an accident
   of how it is written, and lint R6 gates on it at error level.

   Two properties rest on it. The first is that purity makes the state
   space property-testable without spawning processes: a function from
   state and input to an answer can be enumerated rather than supervised.
   The second is that `core` stays compilable to the **JavaScript target**,
   so a browser can decode and analyse a trace with the same code the
   server uses. Every `@external` or BEAM-only dependency closes that door,
   and one closes both properties at once, however deterministic the
   function behind it is: foreign code is trusted unchecked, so it is a
   hole in exactly the claim the property tests rest on. No target is the
   safe one — an Erlang external ends the portability, a JavaScript one
   breaks the BEAM build that ships, and a matched pair still puts
   trusted-unchecked foreign code inside the package whose entire claim is
   that it is a pure function of its arguments. Reach for a clock or an id
   through the injected capabilities of 6 below instead.

   **Portable does not mean the collector runs in a browser.** Reading the
   runtime needs processes, monitors and the VM's own introspection, none
   of which exists on the JavaScript target. What the portable subset buys
   is *deciding but not acting*: decoding, folding and analysing data that
   a collector host already fetched.
6. **Time and identity are injected**: timestamps come from a `Clock`
   capability, ids from an injected generator — never `erlang:system_time`
   or random bytes reached for directly.
7. **Documentation**: every public function documented; every ADT
   constructor's invariants stated in its doc comment.
8. **No naked `Bool`**: a `Bool` is not a function parameter and not a
   record field. Model the question with a two-variant type named for the
   domain (Part III, "No naked `Bool`", which has the three escapes and
   why return position is outside the rule). Lint R9 counts them.
9. **Code is written in stanzas**: a comment has a blank line above it —
   between statements, between `case` arms, and between the variants of a
   custom type — and a body does not run more than about eight statements
   without a break (Part II, "Stanzas: how code breathes"). Statements,
   never lines: a wrapped literal is one statement and a `use` chain is a
   table. **Lint R10 gates**; R11 warns. The exemptions are the two places
   `gleam format` deletes a blank line, the top of a block and between a
   constructor's fields, and a rule must never demand what the formatter
   removes. This is the layout half of the literate register `CLAUDE.md`
   requires: prose a reader cannot find is prose that was not written.
